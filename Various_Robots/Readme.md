## 🧠 My Contributions

### 🔹 Minisumo Robot (2018)
- 🧩 **Electronics**: Designed and built fully standalone motor driver and control PCB (not Arduino-based).
- 🛠️ **Chassis**: Fully designed and assembled the robot structure using lightweight materials.
- ⚙️ **Tuning**: Manual calibration of motors and sensors for line sensing and sumo detection.
- 🏆 Used in regional robotics club tournaments.

### 🔹 Soccer Junior Robot (2018)
- 📦 **Chassis**: Fully custom 3D-printed & MDF-layered robot frame.
- 📐 **Electronics**: Built sensor and motor interfacing system (ultrasonic, IR encoders).
- 🤖 **ROS Integration**: My first attempt at using ROS to handle robot movement and perception.
  - Learned basics of ROS nodes, topics, and sensor integration.
  - Although the project had performance issues, it introduced me to robot middleware.

## 🧾 Notes

- These early builds shaped my passion for system integration and embedded control.
- Lessons from these prototypes led to better PCB design, ROS programming, and mechanical design in future projects.
- Even in the absence of code, I consider them formative experiences in multidisciplinary robotics.
