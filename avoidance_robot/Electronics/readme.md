# 🔧 Custom Standalone Arduino UNO PCB – Robotics Electronics Project

> This project documents a custom-designed printed circuit board created during an electronics and robotics course. The board is centered around a **standalone ATmega328P microcontroller**, replicating the core of an Arduino UNO, and designed to power and control a small mobile robot platform.

## 📐 Design Overview

- 🧠 **Microcontroller**: Standalone **ATmega328P** (Arduino UNO core)
- 🔋 **Power Supply**: Integrated linear regulator and capacitor filtering
- 📦 **Inputs/Outputs**: Pluggable headers for sensors, motors, and power
- 🧲 **Peripheral Support**: Labeled analog/digital pads, motor drivers, LEDs
- 🛠️ **Board Shape**: Circular design optimized for differential robot chassis

## 🧠 My Contributions

- Designed full schematic and PCB layout in **Eagle CAD**
- Implemented **standalone ATmega328P** setup (no Arduino board used)
- Assigned proper footprints and trace widths for high-current paths
- Planned component placement for mechanical alignment and routing efficiency
- Labeled and structured I/O headers for ease of debugging and expansion
