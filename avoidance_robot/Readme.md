# 🚗 Obstacle Avoidance Robot – CROFI Training Project

> A fully autonomous robot built as part of a robotics course taught by **CRODI**. This project introduced me to motion planning logic and real-time decision-making with basic sensors. The robot was designed and assembled from scratch using a minimalist yet effective approach to avoid obstacles.

## 🧠 My Contributions

- 🛠️ **Chassis Design**: Created and machined a custom baseplate for stability and sensor coverage.
- ⚡ **Electronics**: Manually placed and soldered all components on a discrete circuit board (non-Arduino).
- 🔌 **Sensor Integration**: Used infrared sensors for proximity detection, with logic-based direction switching.
- ⚙️ **Motor Control**: H-Bridge driven, allowing bi-directional control of both motors.
