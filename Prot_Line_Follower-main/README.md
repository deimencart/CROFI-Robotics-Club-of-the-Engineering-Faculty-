## 📋 Project Summary

This project features a fully integrated, custom-designed PCB to interface an Arduino Nano with a mobile robot. It controls two DC motors using the L293D H-Bridge IC, reads user input from buttons, regulates power for logic levels, and provides visual feedback via status LEDs.

Designed for:
- Line followers
- Educational mobile platforms
- Mechatronics and robotics learning
